Metta Transliterator
====================

This is a simple program to convert Tripitaka file written in metta font in to
unicode. Metta font text can be found at http://metta.lk/tipitaka/index.html

I collaborated with venerable Mettavihari to write this program. It's in working 
state but according ven. Mettavihari there are some little fixes to be done all 
over the place. Tipitaka is serious business :).

Anguttara Nikaya text should be transliterated without a problem. At the time I 
dropped the ball on this project we were woking on Diga Nikaya. 
Then we both got busy :(

You can compile the program with
$ gcc -o romantouni.out romantouni.c

Then run
./romantouni.out <input file> <output file>

The resources directory includes what I worked with.

I was provided with a file which I later found out to be in ISO-8859 encoding.
(use file command for this). This file is found in resources directory as
Anguttara_Nikaya_1_ISO8859.txt

I used following command to convert it to utf-8.

$ iconv -f iso-8859-15 -t utf-8 file > output.file

The converted file is found as Anguttara_Nikaya_1_UTF8.txt

romantouni only works on utf-8 text. (The program name is actually misleading.
That's thanks to my poor knowledge of the whole thing :D).

The program can now convert the utf8 text to sinhala unicode.
